## You All Meet on the Line at Immigrations

The original classes I had brainstormed (I think these are somewhere in the early versions...) were Human Smuggler, Human Engineer, Human Traveler, Cyborg Soldier, Synth Scientist. I'm curious about how the Synth rules you have above would work out...I agree with you that that classes shouldn't be reduced to a particular skill, but I think the archetypes for the genre are pretty well defined, and they're Pilot, Scoundrel/Smuggler, Head of Security, and Engineer/Mechanic. I like the idea Cyborgs being their own stock, and representing various augmentations with Nature Descriptors. So as part of character creation, you can choose to discard one or two of your Human Nature descriptors and take on two more. Let's see what basic stat blocks for these would look like:

### Humans
|Human Smuggler||
|:---|---|
| **Raw Abilities**|Distribute 8 points between Will and Health; neither stat may have  a rating lower than 2 or higher than 6|
| **Skills** |Manipulator 3, Criminal 3, Fighter 3, Scavenger 2, Explorer 2, Helm 2|
| **Trait** |
| **Weapons**| Any except explosives|
| **Armor**| Any except powered|

|Human Traveler||
|---|---|
| **Raw Abilities**|Distribute 8 points between Will and Health; neither stat may have  a rating lower than 2 or higher than 6|
| **Skills** | Helm 3, Artillerist 3, Xenologist 3, Navigator 2, Persuader 2, Researcher 2|
| **Trait** |
| **Weapons**| Any except explosives and monoblades|
| **Armor**| Any except heavy and powered|

|Human Engineer||
|---|---|
| **Raw Abilities**|Distribute 8 points between Will and Health; neither stat may have  a rating lower than 2 or higher than 6|
| **Skills** |Mechanic 3, Technician 3, Spacer 3, Scrapper 2, Artillerist 2, Cook 2|
| **Trait** ||
| **Weapons**| Any except explosives and monoblades|
| **Armor**| Any except heavy and powered|
### Cyborgs
|Cyborg Soldier||
|---|---|
| **Raw Abilities**|Health 5, Will 3|
| **Skills** |Fighter 4, Artillerist 3, Pilot 2, Rigger 2, Spacer 2|
| **Trait** ||
| **Weapons**| Any |
| **Armor**| Any |
### Synths
Synths do not have Nature. Nor do they have Will or Health. Instead they have an Integrity rating. They also do not have conditions. As the Synth taxes Integrity, they degrade. No skill may be higher than Integrity. They always roll integrity if they do not have the skill. If the task is outside of their mode of operation (MO), Integrity is taxed according to the nature rules. As it depletes, the Synth is going haywire. Error, cannot compute.

|Synth Scientist||
|---|---|
| **Raw Abilities** | Integrity 5 |
| **Skills** |Technician 4, Navigator 3, Researcher 2, Mechanic 3, Xenologist 2|
| **Trait** |
| **Weapons** | Any |
| **Armor**| Any but powered |
