# Skills & Factors

## Artillerist
Artillery is in fact an ancient art. Mastery of the skill requires a deep and
intuitive understanding of geometry, ballistics, classical mechanics, hard-vac
dynamics, and general relativity. Most people get by with the help of a braked
weapons module and good instincts.

Artillerists are adept in the use of crew level heavy weaponry from battery to cannon, large laser, high powered phase weaponry, and ballistics.

__Suggested Help__: Computers, Helm
 __Beginners Luck__: Will
 
 __Suggested help for Artillerist__: Artillerist, Technician*
__Beginner's luck for Artillerist__: Health
>which suggested help and BL do we keep?
#### Artillerist Factors
 _Size of Target_: Of a class above, of the same class, of a lesser class

_Range of Target_: At weapons range, inside of weapons range, outside of
weapons range

 _Additional Factors_: Target is more than two ranges away from weapons range,
within the gravitic influence of a Giant-class planet (or other body of similar
influence)

`*Technician helps Smart weaponry only.`

## -Cartographer-
-For mapping on an overworld scale. See Torchbearer core rules.-

> Deleted because Navigator should rule all mapping in Spacers.

## Civilian
Civilians fuel the machine of society. They work the industries and services required for intergalactic life, fabricate supplies, and operate the moisture farms.

__Suggested Help:__ Clerk, Dealer 

__Beginner's Luck:__ Health

#### Civilian Factors
_Work:_ service industry & supply chain, corporate work & industrial fabrication, computer & technical, hydroponics & terraforming.

_Necessities_: laundry & domestic life, managing warpnet accounts, event planning, finding a job & opening (or closing) a bank account.

_Complaining_: taxes & sports, spouses & weather, commute & foreigners, aliens.

## Clerk
Clerks are stewards of crews, enterprises, corporations, starbases, and sectors. They are adept at recordkeeping and formal communications. Use Dealer to cash in and make deals, not Clerk.

__Suggested Help:__ Civilian, Dealer 

__Beginner's Luck:__ Will

#### _Clerk Factors:_
_Logistics:_ Local, overworld; interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic.

_Paperwork:_ invoice, contract, taxes.

_Cataloguing:_ travel log, business & transactional log, research into the unknown.

_Contracts:_ work for hire, small enterprise, corporate & governmental.

_For:_ party, small enterprise, large enterprise, national or planetary, cluster.

_Email:_ personal, to accountant, to slumlord, to CEO, to government official, to world leader.

## Commander
Leader skills. Mostly for conflicts. See torchbearer core rules.

## Controller
For augmentation rolls for cyborgs. Kind of like Arcanist. Not sure if we will do this but if we do, this is the space to describe whatever skill operates augs.

## Cook
Everybody gotta eat (except for synths. scum. ::spits::).

__Suggested Help:__ Civilian, Rigger 

__Beginner's Luck:__ Will

#### Factors for Cook:
_Table for:_ 1, 4, large group, mess hall

_From:_ fresh food, preserves, MREs., Spoiled food.

*Use survivalist to make potable water, not cook!*

## Criminal
Was thinking of replacing this with the word "smuggler" but smuggler shouls be an archetype, not a skill. Anyway, this is for disguise, lock picking, prying, breaking, and concealing.

>Should this include nefarious hacking and things like shorting out electronic locking mechanisms, hijacking vehicles, etc., or will that be the realm of technician?

## Dealer
Used to cash in, profit, secure deals, secure supplies, or appraise. Test Resources separately when purchasing.

## Engineer
all things shippy and equipmenty. Create plans: reverse engineer, jury rigging, simple EQ, complex EQ, Ship

_Repair_:

_Diagnose_: 

_Interpret blueprints_:

_Add factor for class of object (do not add factor if simple)_: moderately complex, complex, alien.

## Fabricator
( this should just be folded into engineer probably) creating gear and supplies on the go or in town at the equivalent of guilds, requires tools or appropriate machinery.

> I'm all about this being a separate skill. Even in an era of widespread intergalactic travel, being able to make steak out of thin air should count as special.

Scale:

Complexity:

## Fighter
Fighters engage their opponents face to face, in firefights with small arms and hand to hand, either while spacing or on foot.

For use in standard Kill, Capture, and Drive Off conflicts. Roll versus Fighter or Nature.

## Helm
Helm covers the vast technical knowledge required of a ship's captain in order to
operate and pilot a starship. 

To take the helm of any startship is a brutally dangerous task. Fleet captains and hotshot pilots must posess vast technical knowlege of their craft if they are to survive long in the unrelenting gauntlet of deep space travel. Spacers all over the sector make do with a little braked help and a lotta luck.

__Suggested Help__: Navigator, Technician

__Beginners Luck__: Will

## Haggler
Haggler is mostly used when entering Town, for rolling on the town haggling table. 

## Manipulator
For vs. and social conflicts.

## Medic
See Healer from Torchbearer core book (or Medic from USCMC)

## Mentor
I think this is a more appropriate word for this setting than instructor which is used in USCMC.
Obstacle is target's Max Nature.

## Munitioner
You can make and repair weapons, body armor, and ammo. *cocks shotgun* ... don't forget the grenades!

_Class_ (starts at 2): standard, heavy, crew level, WoMD.

_Volatility_: reactive, highly reactive, radioactive.

_Complexity_: standard, smart

`Note: guns and ammo are mostly purchased because they require industrial equipment to fabricate, but this skill can be used in a pinch to convert ammunition or repair or assemble arms and armor. Can also be used to make explosives with the right materials, etc.. At GM discretion.`

## Navigator
Navigators create and interpret sector charts with and without the assistance of a computer.

As navigators explore, they create a chart indicating the places they've visited. Players should not draw a map. Instead, they should list locations and features. If they can pass an Navigator skill test then they are considered to be in possession of accurate charts and data on the sector(s) in question. So long as they are 'on the chart' they can travel between locations without facing obstacles previously encountered. 

When deriving a chart of a place not previously explored, the chart counts as supplies for navigating and pathfinding.

__Suggested Help:__ Technician (only when charting with computers), Scout, Researcher

__Beginner's Luck:__ Will

#### Navigator factors
_Breadth (starts at 2)_: interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic.

_Information_: area personally explored, from standard telescopy, from high powered telescopy, based on word of mouth.

## Negotiator
> Negotiator could potentially be the word for Haggler or Dealer or an almalgam of the two, or even a separate social skill (a la Orator, which is conspicuously missing from these rules). 

-## Operator-
-used to operate terrain vehicles, hydraulic equipment, loaders, trams, drills, and those little rolly grocery carts you can buy at the dollar store.-
> Absorbed by Pilot.

## Persuader
For social conflicts and versus tests to convince.

## Pathfinder
Getting around on the ground and in isolated environments without getting lost.
> @shughr, It's possible pieces of Pathfinder should be absorbed into Scout and Spacer. Not sure what you think.  

## Pilot
Flying and driving.

## Rigger
The rigger is the laborer of the modern world.

##Xenologist
Knowledge of the weirdness of space, alien life forms, and things unknown on the record books. Use Clerk to catalog findings. Kind of like lore master.

## Scavenger
Gotta find fuel & scrap, you know?

## Scout
Same as TB but will encompass some tracking and telescopy.

## Spacer
This covers vacsuit operation and the exection of all sorts of zero-g maneuvers.

## Survivalist
For surviving the environment and creating makeshift stuff to get by out there.

## Tactician
This is for waging war and for firefight and ship-to-ship maneuvers.

## Technician
The computer skill basically. Used to train and repair smart equipment, operate and repair computers and life support, or to help artillerist.

## Researcher
The "scholar" skill but deep reconnaissance on and off the net. Also decoding things or recalling historical facts on the field.
