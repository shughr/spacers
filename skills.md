# Skills & Factors

## Artillerist
Artillery is in fact an ancient art. Artillerists are adept in the use of crew level heavy weaponry from battery to cannon, large laser, high powered phase weaponry, and ballistics. Mastery of the skill requires a deep and
intuitive understanding of geometry, ballistics, classical mechanics, hard-vac
dynamics, and general relativity. Most people get by with the help of a braked
weapons module and good instincts.

Artillerists are adept in the use of crew level heavy weaponry from battery to cannon, large laser, high powered phase weaponry, and ballistics.

__Suggested Help__: Computers, Helm
 __Beginners Luck__: Will
 __Suggested help for Artillerist__: Artillerist, Technician*
__Beginner's luck for Artillerist__: Health
#### Artillerist Factors
 _Size of Target_: Of a class above, of the same class, of a lesser class

_Range of Target_: At weapons range, inside of weapons range, outside of
weapons range

 _Additional Factors_: Target is more than two ranges away from weapons range,
within the gravitic influence of a Giant-class planet (or other body of similar
influence)

`*Technician helps Smart weaponry only.`

## Navigator
An Navigator creates and interprets sector charts with and without the assistance of a computer.

As the Navigator explores, they create a chart indicating the places they've visited. Players should not draw a map. Instead, they should list locations and features. If they can pass an Navigator skill test then they are considered to be in possession of accurate charts and data on the sector(s) in question. So long as they are 'on the chart' they can travel between locations without facing obstacles previously encountered. When creating a chart of a place not previously explored, the cart counts as supplies for navigating and pathfinding.

__Suggested Help:__ Cartographer, Researcher

#### Navigator factors
_Breadth (starts at 2):_ interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic.

_Information:_ area personally explored, from standard telescopy, from high powered telescopy, based on word of mouth.


## Cartographer
For mapping on an overworld scale. See Torchbearer core rules.

## Civilian
Civilians fuel the machine of society. They work the industries and services required for intergalactic life, fabricate supplies, and operate the moisture farms.

#### Civilian Factors
_Work:_ service industry & supply chain, corporate work & industrial fabrication, computer & technical, farming & terraforming.

_Necessities:_ laundry & domestic life, managing warpnet accounts, event planning, finding a job, opening a bank account.

_Complaining:_ taxes & sports, spouses & weather, commute, foreigners, aliens.

## Clerk
Clerks are stewards of crews, enterprises, corporations, starbases, and sectors. They are adept at recordkeeping and formal communications. Use Dealer to cash in and make deals, not Clerk.

#### _Clerk Factors:_
_Logistics:_ Local, overworld; interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic.

_Paperwork:_ invoice, contract, taxes.

_Cataloguing:_ travel log, business log, research.

_Contracts:_ work for hire, small enterprise, corporate.

_For:_ one, party, small enterprise, large enterprise, national, planetary, cluster.

_Email:_ personal, to accountant, to slumlord, to CEO, to government official, to world leader.

## Commander
Leader skills. Mostly for conflicts. See torchbearer core rules.

## Controller
For augmentation rolls for cyborgs. Kind of like Arcanist. Not sure if we will do this but if we do, this is the space to describe whatever skill operates augs.

## Cook
Everybody gotta eat (except for synths. scum. ::spits::).

#### Factors for Cook:
_Table for:_ 1, 4, large group, mess hall

_From:_ fresh food, preserves, MREs., Spoiled food.

*Use survivalist to make potable water, not cook!*

## Criminal
Was thinking of replacing this with the word "smuggler" but smuggler shouls be an archetype, not a skill. Anyway, this is for disguise, lock picking, prying, breaking, and concealing.

>Should this include nefarious hacking and things like shorting out electronic locking mechanisms, hijacking vehicles, etc., or will that be the realm of technician?
>> Simon: Yeah I think that's a good idea. Technicians fix things. Criminals break them.

## Dealer
Used to cash in, profit, secure deals, secure supplies, or appraise. Test Resources separately when purchasing.

## Engineer
all things shippy and equipmenty. Create plans: reverse engineer, jury rigging, simple EQ, complex EQ, Ship

Repair:

Diagnose:

Interpret blueprints

Add factor for class of object: simple, moderately complex, complex, alien.

## Fabricator

( this should just be folded into engineer probably) creating gear and supplies on the go or in town at the equivalent of guilds, requires tools or appropriate machinery.

> I'm all about this being a separate skill. Even in an era of widespread intergalactic travel, being able to make steak out of thin air should count as special.

Scale:

Complexity:

## Fighter
for firefights with small arms and hand to hand, usually on foot.

## Haggler
you know what this is. Mostly for use when entering Town.

## Helm
To take the helm of any startship is a brutally dangerous task. Fleet captains
and hotshot pilots must posess vast technical knowlege of their craft if they
are to survive long in the unrelenting gauntlet of deep space travel. Spacers
all over the sector make do with a little braked help and a lotta luck.
__Suggested Help__: Navigator, Technician
__Beginners Luck__: Will

## Manipulator
For vs. and social conflicts.

## Medic
basically healer (from uscmc)

## Mentor
I think this is a more appropriate word for this setting than instructor which is used in uscmc.

## Munitioner
You can make and repair weapons, body armor, and ammo. *cocks shotgun* ... don't forget the grenades!


Class: small to large.

Volatility: stable to highly reactive to radioactive.

Complexity: manual, smart

`Note: guns and ammo are mostly purchased because they require industrial equipment to fabricate, but this skill can be used in a pinch to convert ammunition or repair or assemble arms and armor. Can also be used to make explosives with the right materials, etc.`

## Navigator

## Negotiator
I might throw this down instead of Broker.

## Operator
used to operate terrain vehicles, hydraulic equipment, loaders, trams, drills, and those little rolly grocery carts you can buy at the dollar store.

## Persuader
...for social conflicts and versus tests.

## Pathfinder
getting around on the ground and in isolated environments without getting lost.

## Pilot
only for ship and flying vehicles.

## Rigger
The rigger is the laborer of the modern world.

##Xenologist
knowledge of the weirdness of space, alien life forms, and things unknown on the record books. Use bookkeeper to catalog findings. Kind of like lore master.

## Scavenger
gotta find scrap, you know?

## Scout
same as TB but will encompass some hunterly stuff like tracking.

## Spacer
This covers vacsuit operation and the exection of all sorts of zero-g maneuvers.

## Survivalist
for surviving the environment and creating makeshift stuff to get by out there.

## Tactician
This is for waging war and for firefight and ship to ship maneuvers.

## Technician
the computer skill basically. Used to train and repair smart equipment and weaponry, operate and repair computers and life support, or to help artillerist.

## Researcher
the "scholar" skill but for thinslicing and doing deep reconnaissance on the net. Also decoding things or recalling historical facts on the field.

## Tactics
