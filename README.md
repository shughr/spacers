# Torches in the Dark
###### A Game of Exploration and Adventure in the Far Future

## Design Goals

1. I would like to emphasize the interior, "architectural" quality of the ship. Functions of the ship should be tied to places in the ship and these places should not be abstracted out of existence by the rules. In other words, where a player is in the ship at any given moment should matter, both to her immediate goals, and to the general state of affairs in the ship. If you've played FTL before, you should have a pretty good idea of what this means. If you haven't played FTL, you should!
2. These rules should add as little as possible to the fundamental mechanics of Torchbearer. Conflict, Advancement, Wises, the Reward cycle etc. should remain absolutely unchanged.
3. The adventure, camp and town phases are distinct modes of play, but still mechanically integrated into each other's reward cycle. Maintaining this integration during ship play will be hugely important if it is to feel like a natural extension of the TB rules.
4. Simplicity should rule the day. I think one of my problems with the USMC expansion is that the ranks system, equipment lists and downtime rules weren't particularly elegant. I want to avoid adding too much inventory complexity or sci-fi tech-fetishism. I would prefer to paint the genre trappings with a broad brush, and let players add the flavorful crunch.

## Rules
### Phases

#### Space
Spacers are scum, villans, rogues, ruffians, pirates and exiles. But at least they have a ship.  Play on the ship exists in a distinct phase, similar to the Adventure, Town and Camp phases. The ship is certainly a vehicle for adventure as it allows the characters to explore the uncharted depths of space, to make discoveries, and to engage in deadly conflict with their adversaries. However, it is also a relatively safe place in the infinite darkness of space: players can heal in the sickbay, dine in the mess hall, get a little R&R in the holodeck etc. And, because of the omnipresence of the Warpnet, players can also interact with the galactic economy: taking jobs, placing orders for equipment to be delivered to their next destination for pickup, sifting throught he bottomless morass of information of the Subsurf. 
So what is the Space phase? The primary goal of the Space phase is the maintenance of the ship, balanced against the players other goals. Just as players are subject to the grind during the Adventure Phase, so to is the Ship during the Space Phase. Players make tests in order to guide their ship through the inky black between stars, to locate the rebel base hidden on the jungle moon of Zgu-C, and to keep pirates at bay long enough to engage the Slingdrive and jump to safety. And while they pursue these goals, the ship slowly falls apart. Seals get brittle and break, rad-shields degrade under the near constant stellar-winds, faultly logic-boards sieze up, cascading throughout the onboard systems, virulent bacterial infections spread like wildfire in the contained ecology of the ships interior. A couple meters of titanium and goldfoam are all that stand between a Spacer and The Void. Grab a spanner, and get to work. 

##### Questions for Space Phase

1. Can players earn checks?
2. How can players spend checks? 
3. What is the order of the Grind for a Ship?
4. What resources are used during Space phase? 

Regarding question #4: I'm thinking here of the two fundamental resources of Torchbearer: light and water. These two resources ideally create 90% of the tension in Torchbearer. We need one or two really strong, tight resource cycles that will drive the Space phase as well. Possible solutions are a harvestable energy resource (solar, nuclear, chemical, whatever) and a ur-material that powers the Fabricators. Or some sort of abstract Scrap that is spent on ship upgrades and the like? Scrap is good because you can find it anywhere (like water in TB) and energy is good because if you really run out, you're fucked.

#### Town
Town rules should remain largely unchanged from the rules as written in TB. Deep-space stations, moonbases, orbital weapons platforms are for all intents and purposes town. I recommend we keep town elements as similar as possible to the Torchbearer town locations: Gate, Market, Temple, Guild Halls, Tavern, and then various levels of lodging, from Flophouse to Hotel. Apply a minimal amount of color to maximize clarity between resources

#### Adventure

#### Camp

### Conflicts in Ship Phase

All conflicts described in the Torchbearer ruleset are assumed here and function
in this game without modification or exception. 

#### Skills and Abilities for Dispositon
|Intent|Roll|Add to Rank|
|------|----|-----------|
|Destroy|Artillerist or Helm|Ship's Nature|
|Pursue|Tactics or Helm|Ship's Nature|
|Disable|Computers or Artillerist*|Ship's Nature|
|Board|Tactics or Fighter|Ship's Nature|

NOTE: This may over-emphasize the ability of the ship relative to the ability of
the characters. I think this is desirable.

#### Conflict Ability and Skills Used by Action
|Type of Conflict|Attack|Defend|Feint|Maneuver|
|----------------|------|------|-----|--------|
|Destroy|Artillerist|Integrity|Artillerist|Helm or Shipsmarts|
|Pursue|Tactics or Helm|Engineering|Tactics or Helm|Engineering or Shipsmarts|
|Disable|Computers|Security|Computers|Security|
|Board|Tactics or Fighter|Computers or Security|Tactics or Fighter|Computers or Security|

*Use of Artillerist in this conflict requires appropriate armament.
### Ships
