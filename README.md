# Torches in the Dark
###### A Game of Exploration and Adventure in the Far Future

## Design Goals

1. I would like to emphasize the interior, "architectural" quality of the ship. Functions of the ship should be tied to places in the ship and these places should not be abstracted out of existence by the rules. In other words, where a player is in the ship at any given moment should matter, both to her immediate goals, and to the general state of affairs in the ship. If you've played FTL before, you should have a pretty good idea of what this means. If you haven't played FTL, you should!  2. These rules should add as little as possible to the fundamental mechanics of Torchbearer. Conflict, Advancement, Wises, the Reward cycle etc. should remain absolutely unchanged.
3. The adventure, camp and town phases are distinct modes of play, but still mechanically integrated into each other's reward cycle. Maintaining this integration during ship play will be hugely important if it is to feel like a natural extension of the TB rules.
4. Simplicity should rule the day. I think one of my problems with the USMC expansion is that the ranks system, equipment lists and downtime rules weren't particularly elegant. I want to avoid adding too much inventory complexity or sci-fi tech-fetishism. I would prefer to paint the genre trappings with a broad brush, and let players add the flavorful crunch.

## Rules
### Phases

#### Space
Spacers are scum, villans, rogues, ruffians, pirates and exiles. But at least they have a ship.  Play on the ship exists in a distinct phase, similar to the Adventure, Town and Camp phases. The ship is certainly a vehicle for adventure as it allows the characters to explore the uncharted depths of space, to make discoveries, and to engage in deadly conflict with their adversaries. However, it is also a relatively safe place in the infinite darkness of space: players can heal in the sickbay, dine in the mess hall, get a little R&R in the holodeck etc. And, because of the omnipresence of the Warpnet, players can also interact with the galactic economy: taking jobs, placing orders for equipment to be delivered to their next destination for pickup, sifting throught he bottomless morass of information of the Subsurf. 
So what is the Space phase? The primary goal of the Space phase is the maintenance of the ship, balanced against the players other goals. Just as players are subject to the grind during the Adventure Phase, so to is the Ship during the Space Phase. Players make tests in order to guide their ship through the inky black between stars, to locate the rebel base hidden on the jungle moon of Zgu-C, and to keep pirates at bay long enough to engage the Slingdrive and jump to safety. And while they pursue these goals, the ship slowly falls apart. Seals get brittle and break, rad-shields degrade under the near constant stellar-winds, faultly logic-boards sieze up, cascading throughout the onboard systems, virulent bacterial infections spread like wildfire in the contained ecology of the ships interior. A couple meters of titanium and goldfoam are all that stand between a Spacer and The Void. Grab a spanner, and get to work. 

##### Questions for Space Phase

1. Can players earn checks?
2. How can players spend checks? 
3. What is the order of the Grind for a Ship?
4. What resources are used during Space phase? 

Regarding question #4: I'm thinking here of the two fundamental resources of Torchbearer: light and water. These two resources ideally create 90% of the tension in Torchbearer. We need one or two really strong, tight resource cycles that will drive the Space phase as well. Possible solutions are a harvestable energy resource (solar, nuclear, chemical, whatever) and a ur-material that powers the Fabricators. Or some sort of abstract Scrap that is spent on ship upgrades and the like? Scrap is good because you can find it anywhere (like water in TB) and energy is good because if you really run out, you're fucked.

#### Town
Town rules should remain largely unchanged from the rules as written in TB. Deep-space stations, moonbases, orbital weapons platforms are for all intents and purposes town. I recommend we keep town elements as similar as possible to the Torchbearer town locations: Gate, Market, Temple, Guild Halls, Tavern, and then various levels of lodging, from Flophouse to Hotel. Apply a minimal amount of color to maximize clarity between resources

#### Adventure

#### Camp

### Conflicts in Space Phase

All conflicts described in the Torchbearer ruleset are assumed here and function
in this game without modification or exception. 

#### Skills and Abilities for Dispositon
|Intent|Roll|Add to Rank|
|------|----|-----------|
|Destroy|Artillerist or Helm|Ship's Nature|
|Pursue|Tactics or Helm|Ship's Nature|
|Disable|Computers or Artillerist*|Ship's Nature|
|Board|Tactics or Fighter|Ship's Nature|

NOTE: This may over-emphasize the ability of the ship relative to the ability of
the characters. I think this is desirable.

#### Conflict Ability and Skills Used by Action
|Type of Conflict|Attack|Defend|Feint|Maneuver|
|----------------|------|------|-----|--------|
|Destroy|Artillerist|Integrity|Artillerist|Helm or Shipsmarts|
|Pursue|Tactics or Helm|Engineering|Tactics or Helm|Engineering or Shipsmarts|
|Disable|Computers|Security|Computers|Security|
|Board|Tactics or Fighter|Computers or Security|Tactics or Fighter|Computers or Security|

*Use of Artillerist in this conflict requires appropriate armament.

### Ships

Ships have the following attributes

#### Name
Every one of these no-good rustbuckets has a name. What's yours? Lola?
#### Insignia
Who gives a shit? There are thousands of Lolas floating through the sector.
What makes yours so special?
#### Make and Model
Where's the nearest dealership?
#### Provenance
She's pretty. Who'd you steal her from?
#### Traits
I've made a lot of special modifications myself.
#### Raw Abilities
##### Integrity
Don't worry, she'll hold together.
##### Security
Seal the blast doors!
#### Class
Sometimes its just a matter of scale. 
#### Nature
This baby's got a few surprises left in her. 
##### Nature Descriptors: See subtable
#### Capabilities
Engine rooms to the left, artillery is below decks, got a little holodeck
upstairs and the mess is just to the right. Everything else is life support.


## Skills & Factors
### Skills & Factors

####Artillerist
Artillerists are adept in the use of crew level heavy weaponry from battery to cannon, large laser, high powered phase weaponry, and ballistics.
#### Artillerist
Artillery is in fact an ancient art. Mastery of the skill requires a deep and
intuitive understanding of geometry, ballistics, classical mechanics, hard-vac
dynamics, and general relativity. Most people get by with the help of a braked
weapons module and good instincts.
###### Suggested Help: Computers, Helm
###### Beginners Luck: Will

######Suggested help for Artillerist: Artillerist, Technician*
######Beginner's luck for Artillerist: Health
###### *Artillerist Factors*
__Size of Target__: Of a class above, of the same class, of a lesser class
__Range of Target__: At weapons range, inside of weapons range, outside of
weapons range
__Additional Factors__:target is more than two ranges away from weapons range,
within the gravitic influence of a Giant-class planet (or other body of similar
influence)

*Technician helps Smart weaponry only.

######_Artillerist Factors:_

For ship-based combative encounters and scrums, roll versus against opponent's Artillerist or Pilot. Also used in ship-to-ship and ship-to-surface conflicts.

####Astronomer
An astronomer creates and interprets sector charts with and without the assistance of a computer.


As the astronomer explores, they create a chart indicating the places they've visited. Players should not draw a map. Instead, they should list locations and features. If they can pass an Astronomer skill test then they are considered to be in possession of accurate charts and data on the sector(s) in question. So long as they are 'on the chart' they can travel between locations without facing obstacles previously encountered. When creating a chart of a place not previously explored, the cart counts as supplies for navigating and pathfinding. 


_Suggested Help:_ Cartographer, Researcher

> Maybe nitpicky, but I vote we rename this to Navigator. Should be suggested
help for Helm.
######_Astronomer factors:_
_Breadth (starts at 2):_ interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic.

_Information:_ area personally explored, from standard telescopy, from high powered telescopy, based on word of mouth.

 
####Cartographer
For mapping on an overworld scale. See Torchbearer core rules.

####Civilian
Civilians fuel the machine of society. They work the industries and services required for intergalactic life, fabricate supplies, and operate the moisture farms.  

######_Civilian Factors:_
_Work:_ service industry & supply chain, corporate work & industrial fabrication, computer & technical, farming & terraforming. 

_Necessities:_ laundry & domestic life, managing warpnet accounts, event planning, finding a job, opening a bank account.

_Complaining:_ taxes & sports, spouses & weather, commute, foreigners, aliens. 

####Clerk 
Clerks are stewards of crews, enterprises, corporations, starbases, and sectors. They are adept at recordkeeping and formal communications. Use Dealer to cash in and make deals, not Clerk. 

######_Clerk Factors:_
_Logistics:_ Local, overworld; interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic.

_Paperwork:_ invoice, contract, taxes.

_Cataloguing:_ travel log, business log, research.

_Contracts:_ work for hire, small enterprise, corporate.

_For:_ one, party, small enterprise, large enterprise, national, planetary, cluster.

_Email:_ personal, to accountant, to slumlord, to CEO, to government official, to world leader.

####Commander
Leader skills. Mostly for conflicts. See torchbearer core rules.

####Controller 
For augmentation rolls for cyborgs. Kind of like Arcanist. Not sure if we will do this but if we do, this is the space to describe whatever skill operates augs.

###Cook 
Everybody gotta eat (except for synths. scum. ::spits::).

######_Factors for Cook:
_Table for:_ 1, 4, large group, mess hall

_From:_ fresh food, preserves, MREs., Spoiled food.

*Use survivalist to make potable water, not cook!

####Criminal
Was thinking of replacing this with the word "smuggler" but smuggler shouls be an archetype, not a skill. Anyway, this is for disguise, lock picking, prying, breaking, and concealing.

Should this include nefarious hacking and things like shorting out electronic locking mechanisms, hijacking vehicles, etc., or will that be the realm of technician?

####Dealer: 
Used to cash in, profit, secure deals, secure supplies, or appraise. Test Resources separately when purchasing.

####Engineer - 
all things shippy and equipmenty. 
Create plans: reverse engineer, jury rigging, simple EQ, complex EQ, Ship
Repair:
Diagnose:
Interpret blueprints:
Add factor for class of object: simple, moderately complex, complex, alien.

###Fabricator - 
( this should just be folded into engineer probably) creating gear and supplies on the go or in town at the equivalent of guilds, requires tools or appropriate machinery.
> I'm all about this being a separate skill. Even in an era of widespread
intergalactic travel, being able to make steak out of thin air should count as
special. 
Scale:
Complexity:

###Fighter - 
for firefights with small arms and hand to hand, usually on foot.

####Helm
Helm covers the vast technical knowledge required of a ships captain in order to
operate and pilot a starship. 

__Suggested Help__ Navigator

###Haggler - 
you know what this is. Mostly for use when entering Town.
 
###Manipulator - 
... For vs. and social conflicts.
 
###Medic - 
basically healer (from uscmc)
 
###Mentor - 
I think this is a more appropriate word for this setting than instructor which is used in uscmc.
> Agreed
~~###Interpreter - ~~
~~language skillz. Or should we just leave wises to be the exclusive realmnof
languages?~~
> I vote that language skills get rolled up into wises, or if you really need to
test something, just test Xenologist.
###Munitioner - 
You can make and repair weapons, body armor, and ammo. *cocks shotgun* ... don't forget the grenades!
Class: small to large.
Volatility: stable to highly reactive to radioactive.
Complexity: manual, smart
Note: guns and ammo are mostly purchased because they require industrial equipment to fabricate, but this skill can be used in a pinch to convert ammunition or repair or assemble arms and armor. Can also be used to make explosives with the right materials, etc.

####Navigator
 
###Negotiator -
?? I might throw this down instead of Broker.

###Operator - 
used to operate terrain vehicles, hydraulic equipment, loaders, trams, drills, and those little rolly grocery carts you can buy at the dollar store.

###Persuader - 
...for social conflicts and versus tests.

###Pathfinder - 
getting around on the ground and in isolated environments without getting lost. 

###Pilot - 
only for ship and flying vehicles.
 > @groverbomb, I dont think this and Operator should be split up. One or the
 other?
###Rigger -
The rigger is the laborer of the modern world.  
> This is fucking great.
###Sage - 
knowledge of the weirdness of space, alien life forms, and things unknown on the record books. Use bookkeeper to catalog findings. Kind of like lore master.
 > I have this listed in the character section as Xenologist?
###Scavenger - 
gotta f ind scrap, you know?

###Scout - 
same as TB but will encompass some hunterly stuff like tracking.

###Spacer
This covers vacsuit operation and the exection of all sorts of zero-g maneuvers. 
###Survivalist - 
for surviving the environment and creating makeshift stuff to get by out there.
 
###Tactician - 
This is for waging war and for firefight and ship to ship maneuvers.
 
###Technician - 
the computer skill basically. Used to train and repair smart equipment and weaponry, operate and repair computers and life support, or to help artillerist.
 
###Researcher - 
the "scholar" skill but for thinslicing and doing deep reconnaissance on the net. Also decoding things or recalling historical facts on the field.

(Question: should there be a dungeoneer equivalent for exploring and driving down into dungeon-like locations? Explorer?
> Response: Definitely. I think Explorer is the way to go. 
*Shane comment: Definitely some holes here but wanted to start laying these out.


##You All Meet on the Line at Immigrations

I also wanted to start hammering out the classes a little bit... 

I don't think the main classes should be pilot, engineer, etc... Those are skills! Not classes. Let's think about the kinds of archetypes that would find this life and use those. So like... Human Smuggler, Scrapper, Mercenary, and for the cyborgs how about Cyborg Brute and Cyborg Savant, or something like that to convey they are weird/special? So you'd have your magic-type classes. Brute being the destroyer type and Savant being all about knowledge and being tricky. 

Or: Human... 
Smuggler, Scrapper, Scribe, Mercenary, Cyborg.

Or: Synth...
Synths do not have nature. Instead they have an Integrity rating. They also do not have conditions. As the Synth taxes Integrity, they degrade. No skill may be higher than Integrity. They do not have will or health. They always roll integrity if they do not have the skill. If the task is outside of their mode of operation (MO), integrity is taxed according to the nature rules. As it depletes, the synth is going haywire. Error, cannot compute.

The original classes I had brainstormed (I think these are somewhere in the
early versions...) were Human Smuggler, Human Engineer, Human Traveler, Cyborg
Soldier, Synth Scientist. I'm curious about how the Synth rules you have above
would work out...I agree with you that that classes shouldn't be reduced to a
particular skill, but I think the archetypes for the genre are pretty well
defined, and they're Pilot, Scoundrel/Smuggler, Head of Security, and
Engineer/Mechanic. I like the idea Cyborgs being their own stock, and
representing various augmentations with Nature Descriptors. So as part of
character creation, you can choose to discard one or two of your Human Nature
descriptors and take on two more. Let's see what basic stat blocks for these
would look like:


#### Helm
To take the helm of any startship is a brutally dangerous task. Fleet captains
and hotshot pilots must posess vast technical knowlege of their craft if they
are to survive long in the unrelenting gauntlet of deep space travel. Spacers
all over the sector make do with a little braked help and a lotta luck.
